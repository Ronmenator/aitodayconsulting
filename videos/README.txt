VIDEOS FOLDER
=============

This folder contains video files for the website.

âœ… VIDEO TAGS ARE ALREADY IN THE HTML - Just add videos here and they'll work!

Required Videos:
1. hero-background.mp4 (1920x1080, 10-15 sec loop) - Hero section background video
2. outcomes-animation.mp4 (1920x1080, 8-10 sec loop) - Outcomes section background video

See IMAGE-PROMPTS.md for Sora prompts to generate these videos.

Videos should be:
- MP4 format (H.264 codec for best compatibility)
- Optimized for web (compressed but good quality)
- Short and looping (10-15 seconds)
- Under 5MB if possible for fast loading

FALLBACK IMAGES:
If videos are not available, the site will automatically show static images from the images/ folder:
- images/hero-background.jpg (as fallback for hero video)
- images/outcomes-background.jpg (as fallback for outcomes video)

MOBILE OPTIMIZATION:
Videos are automatically hidden on mobile devices (< 768px width) to save data and battery.
Static images will show instead on mobile.
